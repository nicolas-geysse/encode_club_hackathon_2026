## 2. Structure du Knowledge Graph global

🧠 Je propose une structure à **3 niveaux de connexions** pour tout le graph :

### **Connection types**

1. **Strong bidirectional** (⟷) - Collaboration fréquente, compétences très transférables
2. **Medium bidirectional** (↔) - Collaboration occasionnelle, compétences partiellement transférables
3. **Weak directional** (→) - Dépendance unilatérale ou collaboration rare
